# CineLog

## üéì Academic Project

CineLog is a web application for movie enthusiasts to catalog, rate, and share their opinions about films. Developed as an academic project for the **Web Development 2** course taught by **Professor Renan Cavichi** (@renancavichi) in the **Analysis and Systems Development program at IFSP**.

Inspired by the [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) platform, CineLog allows users to create a personal collection of watched movies, assign ratings, write comments, and view other users' reviews, but with its own identity and features adapted to the academic context.
